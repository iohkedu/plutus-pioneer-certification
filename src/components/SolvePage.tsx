Example: <code className="bg-gray-200 p-0.5 rounded">length (txInfoInputs txInfo) == ?</code>. If your check contains a question mark (<code className="bg-gray-200 p-0.5 rounded">?</code>), that's a randomly generated number between 3 and 5.</li>
            <li className="list-inside">Modify the off-chain to satisfy that check, and you'll get access to the next check.</li>
